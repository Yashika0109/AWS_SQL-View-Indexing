    "## Case Study\n",
    "Twitter is a massive platform.  There are 300+ million users on Twitter, and it is a source of information for current events, social movements and, financial information.  It has been shown in a number of cases that information from Twitter can mobilize a large number of individuals.  From #blacklivesmatter to other forms of *hashtag* activism, social media can play an important role in informing and mobilizing individuals.\n",
    "\n",
    "This same activity can be extended to financial information.  The introduction of \"cashtags\" to twitter has allowed individuals to connect and discuss stocks, but it has also given stock promoters a method for promoting low value stocks, to \"pump and dump\".  Some researchers have analyzed the use of cashtags on Twitter.  We will use a similar method to look at the data, but we will ask a slightly different question.\n",
